# Olivier's Files with Dots

This is a really tiny repository of my atrocious shell scripts. 

1. I keep them here to remember them, and to back them up.
2. I strongly discourage you — yes, you, with the sexy hair — to use them 
if you don't have the knowledge required to realize that they're 
probably very poorly written and will screw things up for you.

I believe in Bash because it's fast and very many people have it. 
As soon as I installed ZSH, my terminal turned into a French snail and 
while you'd think I'd like those, you'd be mistaken. Especially because 
I use my terminal every single day of my life (pretty much) and that I 
kind of like doing more fun things than waiting for my fucking terminal 
to load a fucking directory.

Bisous,
Olivier.
